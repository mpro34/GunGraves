## GunGraves

This is a game where you travel to various levels, picking up coins, battling various enemies and avoiding some explosives. 
Created in Unreal Engine 4, where only the C++ code is stored here.

Even though there are no guns and/or graves in this game, there is a chance to become a grave yourself or defeat all the enemies!

This game used free assets from the Unreal Engine Marketplace and Mixamo. Some todos would be more gameplay mechanics, like spells and more levels.
